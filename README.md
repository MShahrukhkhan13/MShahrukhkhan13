Human Pose Detection - YOLO Model
This repository provides code to detect human sitting and standing postures using a YOLO pose model. The script is designed to classify if a person is standing or sitting based on their detected pose.

Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate a basic posture detection system. With the help of the YOLO model, we can efficiently detect and classify human poses in images or video frames. This setup can be useful for applications in security, ergonomics, or fitness, where tracking human posture is essential.

Features
Detects human poses in real-time.
Classifies posture as either "Standing" or "Sitting".
Easy to set up and run with a pre-trained YOLO pose model.
